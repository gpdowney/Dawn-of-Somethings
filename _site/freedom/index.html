<ol>
<li>To Move</li>
<li>To Disobey</li>
<li>To Imagine</li>
</ol>
<p>These freedoms are cumulative.
They build on each other.</p>
<p>It's hard to require obedience when folks can walk away.</p>
<p>And disobedience promotes free-thinking, which cultivates imagination.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-to-move" tabindex="-1">Freedom to Move</h2>
<p>The very earliest recorded word for freedom is the Sumerian &quot;ama(r)-gi,&quot; which literally translates to &quot;return to mother.&quot;
This word comes from the periodic Sumerian decrees of debt freedom, aka <strong>jubilee</strong>, which allowed debt peons to return home.</p>
<p>The freedom of movement is sustained by both letting folks leave and welcoming visitors.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-to-disobey" tabindex="-1">Freedom to Disobey</h2>
<p>Indigenous Americans took the freedom to disobey seriously.</p>
<p>In 1642, a Jesuit Missionary criticized the Innu for being “wild ass colts” who didn’t fear authority:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the authority of their chief is in his tongue’s ends for he is only powerful in so far as he is eloquent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1644, another Jesuit criticized the Wendat.
He claimed that no people on earth were freer.
They only obeyed the laws and authority that pleased them.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-to-imagine" tabindex="-1">Freedom to Imagine</h2>
<p>Graeber and Wengrow also call the freedom to imagine, &quot;the freedom to reorganize social relations.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, this is the freedom to self-govern.
Or you might call it the freedom to make (and break) promises.
Since both promises and imagination look into the future.</p>
<p>One of the most dehumanizing aspects of slavery is that the master's total control prevents slaves from keeping their commitments to themselves and others.</p>
