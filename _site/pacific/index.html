<h2 id="slavery-among-the-kwakiutl" tabindex="-1">Slavery among the Kwakiutl</h2>
<p>On the Pacific Northwest coast, including among the Kwakiutl, slaves made up about 25% of the population.
Similar to the ratio in the Roman Empire, classical Athens, and not so far behind the American Plantation South.</p>
<p>The institution of slavery was developed, in part, to deal with the bounty of anadromous fish (like salmon).
Bulk harvesting involved intensive labor.
Both bulk harvesting and the first signs of warfare and forts (as well as ornate burials) emerge around 1850 BCE.</p>
<p>Elites, who believed themselves above fishing, put themselves at the mercy of transient commoners.
If they were insufficiently generous, or took too much tribute, the commoners would switch nobles.
Slavery provided a solution that worked for both elites and commoners.
Slaves were a captive labor source consistent with the noble's self-conception of superiority and the commoner's freedom of movement.
(Not unlike plantation owners recruiting low-status whites to support slavery in the Civil War.)</p>
<p>Kwakiutl elites would never chop wood.</p>
<p>In contrast, Californians had few slaves and made chopping wood for the sauna a sacred duty.</p>
<h2 id="yurok-karin-hupa-had-few-slaves" tabindex="-1">Yurok-Karin-Hupa had few slaves</h2>
<p>And they kept some, temporary slaves from wars and debt-peonage.
Limited slavery may have developed as a compromise that allowed the Californians to resist the fuller violence of their northern neighbors.</p>
<p>Southern Californians, like the Maidu, Wintu, and Pomo, burned money at death, had no slaves, and few conflicts turned into wars (because victors had to pay compensation for everyone they killed).</p>

<h2 id="chetco-refused-to-own-slaves" tabindex="-1">Chetco refused to own slaves</h2>
<p>The Chetco of Southern Oregon refused to own slaves.
Their myths warned of the dangers of slavery, to the slave-owners.</p>
<p>In the Chetco's origin story, they canoed down from the north, wiped out the other warlike group, and enslaved the pacifist (and white) Wogies.
They grew fat and lazy on the Wogies labor and skill.
When the Wogies ran away, the lazy Chetco were unable to chase them.
They called Europeans &quot;Wogies&quot; also.
Chetco survivors saw European genocide as retribution for their past sins of slavery.</p>
<p>The Chetco told a number of other moralized stories about slavery.</p>
<p>In one, a leader defeats the invading slaver group.
Instead of enslaving them, he sets them and their slaves free to be like normal humans.
And he poignantly refuses to let the newly freed slaves carry his boat to the water.</p>
<h2 id="yurok-karin-hupa-had-money" tabindex="-1">Yurok-Karin-Hupa had money</h2>
<p>They did have money.
It was real money.
Money could be used to buy or lease private property.</p>
<p>Most other &quot;Indian money&quot; like wampum or beads, were European projections and could only used to pay fines and remember agreements.
Until, of course, the Europeans made their mistaken ideas real (reification) by accepting wampum and beads in trade.</p>
<p>The Yurok-Karin-Hupa also allowed inheritance, and thus established some durable hierarchies between rich and poor families.</p>
<p>The Californians also had an ethic of work, thrift and simplicity that closely resembled Max Weber's Protestant Ethic.
But they didn't develop capitalism.
Wealth couldn't be turned into more wealth.</p>
<h2 id="potlatch" tabindex="-1">Potlatch</h2>
<p>The potlatch, celebrated from the Klamath to the Copper Rivers was a &quot;grease feast.&quot;
Potlatch was held to celebrate a noble's new title, which was a frequent occurrence.</p>
<p>They featured acts of generosity meant to crush rivals.
They often culminated in destruction, including breaking heirloom copper shields and eating slaves.</p>
