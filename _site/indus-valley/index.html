<p>circa 2600-1900 BCE.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization was a vast empire, centered at Mohenjo-daro.</p>
<p>Indus Valley Civilization may have had both a caste society and relative material equality.</p>
<p>Mohenjo-daro had a street grid, uniform bricks, and a clear division between the upper and lower city.</p>
<p>The upper city features a massive public bath,
and streets too narrow for ox-pulled carts.
It may have been populated with a Brahmin-like upper class that prioritized purity,
including both cleanliness and abstention from worldly duties.</p>
<p>The lower city may have been richer.
All evidence of gems, art, metal, commerce, writing, standard weights, and politics comes from the lower city.</p>
<p>There might have been a caste, but the first mention is in the Rig Veda, from 1200 BCE.
It's risky to infer backwards 1000 years.
And there weren't any signs of Kshatriyas, the heroic warrior-aristocrats of the Rig Veda.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley is known as a &quot;faceless&quot; civilization because there are no monuments to famous leaders, and no elaborate burials.</p>
