<p>The Classical Maya were a centralized empire.</p>
<p>Around 800 CE a popular revolt led to decentralization.
Monarchs were reduced to ceremonial powers.
Monuments like Chichen Itza became assembly halls, or were abandoned.
They stopped playing ball games.</p>
<p>The revolt may have been led by women.
Art after 800 CE shows a rise in the prominence of women.</p>
<p>When the Classical Maya civilization &quot;collapsed,&quot; millions of people disappeared.
Unlike earlier <a href="/dawn/olmec">Olmec</a> &quot;collapses&quot; this one did effect folks in the countryside.
This &quot;collapse&quot; was not just a disaster, but also a choice.</p>
<p>By the time of Spanish conquest, Maya culture was completely decentralized.
And the culture featured many stories that described the disasters that had and would befall would-be-kings.</p>
<p>The decentralized Maya, in contrast to the empires of the <a href="/dawn/aztec">Aztec</a> and <a href="/dawn/inca">Inca</a>, were difficult to conquer.
Revolts began as soon as conquest finished, and continued through the 1800s and 1900s.
Arguably, with the Zapatistas, they still haven't been conquered.</p>
