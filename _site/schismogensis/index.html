<p>Humans in the past traveled.
It's silly to think that they would have been unaware of the technologies used by neighbors less than a month's travel away.</p>
<p>So why didn't everyone adopt the same useful tools?
Because cultures often define themselves in opposition to their neighbors.</p>
<p>This definition by difference is called <em>schismogensis</em>.</p>
<p>We can see it today in the increasingly sharp cultural divides between democrats and republicans.</p>
<p>For example, Alaskan Athabaskans largely refused to use Inuit kayaks.
And conversely, Inuit folks long refused to wear the Athabaskans' snowshoes.</p>
<p>This wasn't reactive.
They each considered: What kind of people would this make us?
And they made a conscious decision.</p>
<p>Or consider a more European example of values defined in opposition:</p>

<p>Economists/technological determinists and post-structuralists/cultural determinists are both wrong.
We may be constrained by environment, chance, technology, and language.
But none of these factors is determinative.
Culture isn't determined, it's chosen.</p>
