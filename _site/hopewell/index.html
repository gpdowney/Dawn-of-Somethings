<p>The Hopewell Interaction Sphere was a massive ritual and diplomatic network centered on Ohio circa 1000 BCE to 800 CE.</p>
<p>Burial mounds at Hopewell include treasures from the entire continent:</p>
<ul>
<li>obsidian from Appalachia,</li>
<li>copper from the Great Lakes,</li>
<li>shark teeth from the Gulf of Mexico,</li>
<li>grizzly molars from the Rockies,</li>
<li>alligator teeth from Florida,</li>
<li>and even meteoric iron from outer space</li>
</ul>
<p>In stark contrast to the <a href="/dawn/bureaucracy">Mesopotamian bureaucrats</a>, who attempted to achieve equality through standardization,
the Hopewell people seemed to have aimed for equality through a celebration of difference.</p>
<p>Few figures in Hopewell art have the same hairdo.
Burials show a wide range of art, insignia, and dress.</p>
<p>And theres no evidence of warfare, although they might have played lacrosse.</p>
<p>The civilization began to decline as folks adopted maize.</p>
<p>They were succeeded by <a href="/dawn/cahokia">Cahokia</a>.</p>
