<p>This site is an abridged outline of <em>the Dawn of Everything</em> by David Graeber and David Wengrow (2021)</p>
<p>I'm Graham.
Like most readers of the <em>Dawn of Everything</em>, I'm not an expert on anthropology or archeology.
But I am pretty good at reading.</p>
<p>For 18 months, I repeatedly tired, and failed, to get through the <em>Dawn of Everything</em>.</p>
<p>It is an inspiring book full of good and fresh ideas.
But it is also badly written and poorly organized.</p>
<p>So, for <em>our</em> sake, I resolved to make these notes to make things easier for all of us.</p>
<p>For dedicated readers, I hope these notes provide some structure that helps you navigate and appreciate the book.</p>
<p>For critical readers, these notes may help you identify the book's core claims so that they can be more clearly evaluated as true or false.</p>
<p>For busy readers, perhaps these notes are all you need, and you can skip the book.</p>
<p>For my sake, making these notes was the motivation I needed to (mostly) finish reading.</p>
<p>If you'd like to also enjoy the benefits of making some notes,
or if you think anything here is wrong (whether the mistake is mine or the Davids'),
I'd love to add your thoughts to this website.</p>
<p>Email <a href="mailto:dawn@gpdetc.org">dawn@gpdetc.org</a> with your additions, corrections, criticisms, or feedback.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you are David Wengrow...</p>
<ol>
<li>Thank you for writing this amazing book.</li>
<li>I would be thrilled to collaborate on an <em>official</em> abridged edition.</li>
