<p>circa 3150 BC to 30 BC</p>
<p>Pharaonic Egypt was a type 2 state--meaning it combined 2 forms of domination: sovereignty and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The Pyramids were 0th industrial revolution.
Work was broken into repetitive chunks,
and done by interchangeable workers on a near assembly line.
The Egyptians fused violence to information by abstracting care labor, and turning it into mechanical labor.</p>
<p>All of this work was done in service of &quot;caring&quot; for the dead king.
In return, the Pharaoh served as a bridge to the sacred, performing rituals on behalf of the people.
Controlling access to the sacred is the original form of bureaucracy (aka the control of information).</p>
<p>Despite very different geographies, the Egyptians and <a href="/dawn/inca">Inca</a> (also a second order state combining sovereignty and bureaucracy) had a number of structural parallels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mummies holding property</li>
<li>God-kings on tour</li>
<li>Ceremonial capitals</li>
</ul>
