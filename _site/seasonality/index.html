    <h1 id="seasonality-shows-our-capacity-to-deliberately-change-how-we-live" tabindex="-1">Seasonality shows our capacity to deliberately change how we live</h1>
<p>The fossil record and anthropological studies reveal that many human societies change with the seasons.</p>
<p>These changes can be dramatic.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Plains Indians had seasonal cops, the <a href="#buffalo-police">Buffalo Police</a></li>
<li>Early cities, like Stonehenge, were seasonal centers -- people shifted from urban to rural and back again.</li>
<li>Many cultures, including <a href="#nambikwara">Nambikwara</a> alternate between agriculture and less intensive forms of food production with the seasons.</li>
<li>In other cultures, like the <a href="#kwakiutl">Kwakiutl</a>, individuals have different <strong>names</strong> in summer and winter.</li>
</ul>
<p>And studies of resource, like by the <a href="#inuit">Inuit</a>, show that seasonal shifts aren't primarily driven by ecological or technological constraints; they are deliberate choices.</p>
<p>Seasonality provides more evidence that civilization and &quot;progress&quot; and cities and agriculture are not one-way ratchets.</p>
<h2 id="buffalo-police" tabindex="-1">Buffalo Police</h2>
<p>The Cheyenne, Crow, Assiniboine, and Lakota peoples of the Great Plains had a temporary state: the buffalo police.</p>
<p>The Plains Indians knew that the police power was dangerous.
They limited the power by rotating the responsibility between clans and moieties.
One season you were the police, the next you were the policed.</p>
<p>(Source on the Plains Indians: Robert Lowie.)</p>
<h2 id="nambikwara" tabindex="-1">Nambikwara</h2>
<p>The Nambikwara (in present day Mato Grosso, Brazil) spend the dry half of the year foraging and hunting.
During this dry season, a single male leader bosses everyone around.</p>
<p>Then, in the wet season, society settles into horticultural villages around charismatic leaders.
But in the wet season, the leader loses their power to command.
Their power is based on their ability to run a redistributive welfare program.
And they are expected to lead by example.
These leaders, in a common pattern across many human societies, are constrained by 2 requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>They work harder than everyone else, to set an example.</li>
<li>They demonstrate their wealth by giving everything away.</li>
</ol>
<p>These charismatic leaders are sophisticated political actors.
And so is everyone else.
Like the buffalo police, this seasonal system is designed to prevent the establishment of fixed leaders or a coercive state.
Amazonian groups like the Nambikwara have long known enough about states to want to avoid becoming one.
After all, the <a href="/dawn/inca">Inca</a> were right next door.</p>
<p>(Ethnographer of Nambikwara: Claude Levi-Stauss)</p>
<h2 id="inuit" tabindex="-1">Inuit</h2>
<p>The circumpolar Inuit (circa 1903) had 2 sets of social structures and laws.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>season</th>
<th>mode</th>
<th>leadership</th>
<th>gender</th>
<th>property</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>summer</td>
<td>hunting and fishing in small, mobile groups</td>
<td>coercive hierarchy</td>
<td>male leaders</td>
<td>private</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>winter</td>
<td>large wood houses near seal and walrus</td>
<td>no formal leadership</td>
<td>equality, non-monogamy</td>
<td>shared</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Physical conditions were not determinant for the Inuit.
By Mauss' calculations, the availability of food and lumber only explain 40% of the decision.
It was a deliberate choice to change how they lived.</p>
<p>(Ethnographer of the Inuit: Mauss and Beuchat's &quot;Seasonal Variations of the Eskimo&quot; from 1903)</p>
<h2 id="kwakiutl" tabindex="-1">Kwakiutl</h2>
<p>The Kwakiutl, on the Northwest Coast, inverted the Inuit.</p>
<p>They were hierarchical in winter, collecting in grand palaces and hosting the potlatch.
They were more egalitarian in summer, when they left to fish.</p>
