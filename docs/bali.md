# Bali

Bali, a small island, became densely populated thanks to a system of wet-rice cultivation, the seka system.

In the middle ages, Bali adopted Hinduism.
Society was organized in a strict hierarchy.
Each individual had a specific and unique rank.

At the same time, in the seka (rice cultivation) system, everyone was an equal.
Everyone had an equal vote,
and an equal obligation to participate.
High status individuals who failed to join meetings were fined.
Fines were used to feed folks at the meeting.

There was a great deal of squabbling over the many tiny kingdoms on Bali.

At the same time, the crucial irrigation system is managed by consensus between the actual farmers (aka people with skin in the game).
