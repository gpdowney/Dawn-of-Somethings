They founded Tenochtitlan in lake Texcoco and became the Aztec triple alliance. Tenochtitlan was modeled on, and only a days walk from Teotihuacan . Chichimec ancestors Nahuatl speakers, including the Aztec and Tlaxcalans, claimed the Chichimec as holy ancestors. The Chichimec were an ascetic desert and forest folk who rejected corn, clothes, and religion. Note: Rousseau's description of the State of Nature is remarkably similar to Aztec descriptions of the Chichimec. See, Enlightenment books were often about Americans . Tenochtitlan v. Tlaxcala Circa 1560 CE, when Cort\u00e9s arrived, Tenochtitlan and Tlaxcala were two rival cities. Tenochtitlan was the Sparta to Tlaxcala's Athens. Like Athens, Tlaxcala was a relatively unique democracy amidst oligarchies. Tlaxcala's democracy is evidenced by (a) Cort\u00e9s, Motolin\u00eda, and other Spanish reports (b) the urban plan. Tlaxcala featured grand plazas (for public debate) and universally high quality housing. There was no palace or ball court. According to the reports of Motolin\u00eda, at Cholula and other Aztec cities leadership, the Teuctli, rotated between elites. Aztec leaders, like Moctezuma, who were merely speakers for a confederation of noble families. But at Tlaxcala, the Teuctli were elected. The Tlaxcalans also recognized that elections aren't democracy. Tlaxcala agreed to help Cort\u00e9s defeat the Aztec At first, Tlaxcala resisted Cort\u00e9s. They lost every battle with the Spanish, but the Spanish force was small, so they were winning by attrition. With Cort\u00e9s camped outside Tlaxcala's gates, the Ayuntamiento (city council) debated whether it might be better to ally with Cort\u00e9s. Some, like Max\u00eexcatzin, argued that with Cort\u00e9s, they could finally defeat their rivals, the Teotihuacans. Xicotencatl the elder, 100 years old and blind, gave an impassioned speech in opposition: They are no gods, they are insatiable, they act in the way of those who would be cruel masters, why would we, who have no kings, spill our blood to make ourselves slaves... The Ayuntamiento was divided. Temilotecutl offered a creative synthesis: Xicotencatl the Younger would ambush Cort\u00e9s after inviting him in. If the ambush failed, they'd denounce Xicotencatl the Younger as a rouge, and ally with Cort\u00e9s. The ambush failed. Without the Tlaxcalans, Cort\u00e9s and his 1000 Spaniards could never have captured the 250,000 Aztecs of Tenochtitlan. The Aztec were vulnerable to colonization The Aztec (and Inca ) empires were ideal subjects for colonization because they had: Identifiable kings and capitals that could be captured. People accustomed to obedience, and the infrastructure of social control. Resentful subjects & neighbors willing to ally with Europeans.

In the middle ages, Bali adopted Hinduism. Society was organized in a strict hierarchy. Each individual had a specific and unique rank. At the same time, in the seka (rice cultivation) system, everyone was an equal. Everyone had an equal vote, and an equal obligation to participate. High status individuals who failed to join meetings were fined. Fines were used to feed folks at the meeting. There was a great deal of squabbling over the many tiny kingdoms on Bali.

Cahokia was a 2nd-order state, combining violence and charisma. Cahokia's reach extended from Virginia to Minnesota. They expanded control through violent colonization. Cahokia was in a fertile area for maize, but also a swamp. In the Mississippian religion, these watery places were connected to the chaotic underworld. And Cahokia may have began as a place of pilgrimage. Cahokia played a violent sport, chunkey. Not unlike the Olmec Ball Games. Commoners could win their way to nobility through heroic achievement in war or chunkey. Around 1350 CE, Cahokia and it's tributary towns began to depopulate. Something happened that left bad memories. By 1400 CE, the entire region, the \"American Bottom,\" despite being fertile, was abandoned.

The prototypical charismatic leader might be the schoolyard bully--not the biggest kid, but the kid who has that ineffable power to make everyone want to please them and do what they say. The Invention of Competitive Politics Large basalt statutes of Olmec leaders have them wearing ball caps. Olemc politics may have emerged from the ball game. Olmec techniques of statecraft, like resource-gathering and diplomacy, likely developed to facilitate the rituals of the game. And the winners of the game likely took the principles of competition from the game into politics. In other words, the game created the state. Chaokia, a violent Mississippian culture, also selected leaders based on a warlike game called chunkey. It's not coincidental that the United States has highly competitive politics, and we tend to often choose leaders who are charismatic movie stars, sports guys, and military heroes. Heroic Societies Circa 1920, Hector Munro Chadwick wondered: Why do the great traditions of epic poetry all come from people who were in contact with great urban civilizations, even employed by those urbanists, but who rejected urban values? For example: Norse sagas Homer's Iliad and Odyssey the Ramayana Chadwick called these \"Heroic Societies.\" They shared broad similarities: favoring oral storytelling over writing games determine status focus on personal debts of loyalty and vengeance fiefdoms instead of central authority competition for slaves and followers competition by squandering wealth (like the Potlatch) In another example of schismogensis , these heroic societies likely defined themselves against their urban neighbors. Other societies that resemble this pattern include: Kurgans, Kwakiutl, M\u0101ori, and Genghis Khan's Mongols. Charisma and Legitimacy Graeber and Wengrow aren't clear about how exactly charisma becomes a source of domination. I've made the connection to \"legitimacy\" in order to parallel sovereignty and bureaucracy. This was based, in part, on an episode of Love Island on Netflix. Reality TV is perhaps the purest form of charisma competition. On this show, one particularly charismatic participant was able to control the entire narrative.

At the same time, I was also deeply frustrated by it. Unfortunately, The Dawn of Everything is unkind to readers. It is poorly written, disorganized, and whiney. Poorly written Like many academic authors, the Davids seem afraid of periods. They cram too many ideas into long sentences, break those ideas up with distracting parentheticals, and confound the reader with unnecessarily erudite language. Disorganized The book is full of digressions. The Davids do apologize for the constant interruptions. But if they knew to apologize, that means they knew they were making things hard on the reader. As a substitute for logical organization, the Davids provide frequent and tedious roadmap paragraphs. Unfortunately, these roadmaps are ineffectively broad. Rather than connecting the details or guiding a way forward, they tend to repeat the same big picture conclusions. Whiney One of those frequently repeated points is something like: Mainstream academics are stupid and lazy. This academic bickering is boring and confusing. Reading the book often felt like having one of those awful conversation with a friend who's complaining about people you don't know. You might sympathize at first, but the more they complain, the less you trust them. This bickering also undermined one of the Davids' other frequently repeated points: that they are merely summarizing recent academic research.

For Hobbes, civilization saves us from relapsing into a war of all against all, aka hell on earth. Rousseau's story echos the fall from grace. Rousseau's state of nature is an Eden that we cannot return to without also giving up civilization. Hobbes believes that we can only be united by our self-interest in self-preservation. In this view, families are the fundamental unit of social organization. Families stick together because of their shared genetic interest in protecting children. And naturally, these families are led by an alpha male.

Our ancestors were more creative than us Contrary to popular belief, the idea of the \"noble savage\" wasn\u2019t invented by Rousseau. It was the creation of racist conservatives 100 years later, in order to criticize Rousseau for being soft-headed about Americans. Rousseau\u2019s actual mistake was the \u201cstupid\u201d savage.

In contrast, Pierre Clastres (a French anthropologist of the 1960s) argues that Indigenous Americans are more politically imaginative than contemporary Europeans. Americans deliberately chose to adopt (or not) bureaucracies, agriculture, and private property. Language doesn't speak us Cultural determinists claim that \"language speaks us.\" This isn't true. These anthropologists have tried to trace the spread of cultures by tracing movements and changes in language. They've tried to use language groups in order to map distinct \"culture areas.\" But language and culture are not always closely tied. For example, in Northern California in the early 1900s there was a jumble of language families, but roughly similar cultural practices. Group identity was based on subtle cultural distinctions. And within a group a single language was usually spoken. But groups speaking different languages (Athabaskan, Na-Dene, Ute-Aztecan) had far more in common with their neighbors than far off speakers of the same language group.

Sovereignty violence force Bureaucracy information expertise Charisma legitimacy popularity States, against a unified theory Until very recently, few states exerted all three aspects of control over their people. Of course, rulers have long claimed to have total control. But a ruler's statements about their monopoly on force, popularity, or expertise, is often as true as their statements about their ability to control the weather. States, against teleological progression Historians, following Turgot, have often assumed that states all emerged in similar ways: Agriculture led to a surplus, which then had to be managed by a bureaucracy. The bureaucracy required centralized leadership. Then those leaders started competing with each other for control. In other words: Bureaucracy --> Sovereignty --> Charisma . But there are plenty of counter-examples. For example, in Mesopotamia , the path looked more like: temple workshops (bureaucracy) --> heroes from the hinterland (charisma, by schismogensis) --> warrior kings (sovereignty) Or a king might rise to power on their heroism (charisma) and then start a new religion (bureaucracy) and later empower the priests with police power (sovereignty). In short, there are diverse paths to unfreedom. And not all states develop all three forms of domination. 1st-Order States In a 1st-order state, the state uses only 1 of the 3 aspects of domination.

These are the first states we might recognize, but there's always an avenue of freedom left open. Examples: The Inca and Pharaonic Egyptians fused sovereignty to bureaucracy.

It is not a coincidence that Europeans had feudal, dynastic monarchy 2000+ years, and then got enlightened right after meeting Americans. It is also true that eastern cultures had an influence. As did classical Greek and Roman thought. But medieval Europeans had access to Greek and Roman thought. And Asia wasn't so far away that folks didn't travel and trade. The spark of the Enlightenment was lit by contact with Americans. The most important Enlightenment concepts, like democracy and reasoned debate, came from America. Enlightenment books were often about Americans Enlightenment books often took the form of debates or dialogues with Americans. For example, Lahontan's \"Curious Dialogues With A Savage Of Good Sense\" (1703), recorded his debates with Kandiaronk, a Wendat statesman, warrior, politician and orator. Many of the most popular texts of the time were travelogues or novels romanticizing Americans. Madame de Graffigny's Zilia (1747), about an Inca princess, was the first European novel about a woman that didn't end with her dead or married. And it may have been the first work to introduce the idea of state socialism through redistributive taxation. Montaigne often said explicitly that he was inspired by Americans. And everyone knew the \"state of nature\" was America. Rousseau's state of nature is remarkably similar to Aztec myths about the Chichimec. Montesquieu likely got his theory of separation of powers after hearing the Osage talk about their system of government. Americans weren't sock puppets for European radicals These dialogues didn't only offer radicals with political cover. 2 sets of skeptics have made this claim: Racists who deny the possibility that Indigenous Americans could have had ideas that were superior to European ideas. Woke revisionists who claim that Europeans could not have possibly understood Indigenous Americans while also colonizing and killing them. These skeptical types have even claimed that Leibniz, who explicitly called for European governments to adopt Chinese-style bureaucracies, wasn't influenced by Chinese thought. Philosophical debate was, literally, the Jesuit\u2019s job. Of course they debated the Americans. The Enlightenment's emphasis on rationality, over other rhetorical techniques, came from Americans The Jesuits were pleased to debate everyday Americans because the average American was a far more interesting conversation partner than the average Frenchman. The Iroquois valued rational debate highly. This value came from their freedom to disobey. They obeyed only when they agreed with the leader's reasoning. So reasoning was power. And because anyone could disagree, everyone got the opportunity to practice. Notably, Iroquois chose to favor reason over other rhetorical techniques, like appeals to emotion, myth, or prophesy. It's telling that the Enlightenment thinkers also favored reason. In Europe, before contact with Americans, obedience had been a far greater virtue than rationality. That changed shortly after the Europeans met the Americans. Human Rights were invented to criticize the profitable violence of colonization Cortes and Pizarro were unauthorized. But also profitable. So there was great demand for a justification. The Conquistadors tried least 3 unsuccessful justifications: Classifying Americans as infidels--re-usuing the justification of the Crusades. But unlike non-Christians of the Ottoman Empire, Americans hadn't had a chance to read the Bible. Reading a Latin declaration calling on people to convert right before attacking, but this was clearly not a fair chance to convert. Claiming Americans weren\u2019t human, which was clearly untrue. This dilemma--that the Conquistadors' extreme violence was both troublesome and profitable--lead to the concept of Human Rights . Human rights or Natural Rights are the rights we have simply by virtue of being human.

For example, Lahontan's \"Curious Dialogues With A Savage Of Good Sense\" (1703), recorded his debates with Kandiaronk, a Wendat statesman, warrior, politician and orator. Many of the most popular texts of the time were travelogues or novels romanticizing Americans. Madame de Graffigny's Zilia (1747), about an Inca princess, was the first European novel about a woman that didn't end with her dead or married. And it may have been the first work to introduce the idea of state socialism through redistributive taxation. Montaigne often said explicitly that he was inspired by Americans. And everyone knew the \"state of nature\" was America. Rousseau's state of nature is remarkably similar to Aztec myths about the Chichimec. Montesquieu likely got his theory of separation of powers after hearing the Osage talk about their system of government.","title":"Enlightenment books were often about Americans"},{"location":"enlightenment/#americans-werent-sock-puppets-for-european-radicals","text":"These dialogues didn't only offer radicals with political cover. 2 sets of skeptics have made this claim: Racists who deny the possibility that Indigenous Americans could have had ideas that were superior to European ideas.

The Iroquois valued rational debate highly. This value came from their freedom to disobey. They obeyed only when they agreed with the leader's reasoning. So reasoning was power. And because anyone could disagree, everyone got the opportunity to practice. Notably, Iroquois chose to favor reason over other rhetorical techniques, like appeals to emotion, myth, or prophesy. It's telling that the Enlightenment thinkers also favored reason. In Europe, before contact with Americans, obedience had been a far greater virtue than rationality.

Examples of matriarchy Iroquois longhouses were run by a woman's council, including Kandiaronk's Wendat.

Slavery among the Kwakiutl On the Pacific Northwest coast, including among the Kwakiutl, slaves made up about 25% of the population. Similar to the ratio in the Roman Empire and classical Athens. Note: Graeber and Wengrow also claim this was the same share as the American Plantation South. But that's not true. In Georgia, slaves went from 19% in 1750 to 44% of the population in 1860 CE. In Virginia, slaves generally made up around 40% of the population, declining to 30% by 1860 CE. In 1860 CE, slaves made up more than 50% of the population of Mississippi and South Carolina. Source The Kwakiutl institution of slavery was developed, in part, to deal with the bounty of anadromous fish (like salmon). Bulk harvesting involved intensive labor. Both bulk harvesting and the first signs of warfare and forts (as well as ornate burials) emerge around 1850 BCE. Elites put themselves above fishing. But this made them dependent on transient commoners. If they were insufficiently generous, or took too much tribute, the commoners would switch nobles. Slavery provided a solution that worked for both elites and commoners. Slaves were a captive labor source consistent with the noble's self-conception of superiority and the commoner's freedom of movement. Similarly, Kwakiutl elites would never chop wood. In contrast, Californians had few slaves and made chopping wood for the sauna a sacred duty. (Ethnographer of the Kwakiutl: Franz Boas.) Californians had few slaves Yurok, Karin, and Hupa kept some, temporary slaves from wars and debt-peonage. Limited slavery may have developed as a compromise that allowed the Californians to resist the fuller violence of their northern neighbors. Southern Californians, like the Maidu, Wintu, and Pomo, burned money at death, had no slaves, and few conflicts turned into wars. War was unprofitable because the victors were required to pay compensation for everyone they killed. (Ethnographer: Goldschmidt on the Yurok. Alfred Kroeber.) The Chetco refused to own slaves The Chetco of Southern Oregon consciously rejected slavery. Their myths warned of the dangers of slave-ownership. In the Chetco's origin story, they canoed down from the north, wiped out the other warlike group, and enslaved the pacifist (and light-skinned) Wogies. They grew fat on the Wogies labor and skill. When the Wogies ran away, the \"lazy\" Chetco were unable to chase them. This was meant as a lesson on the physical and moral degradation that comes with slave-ownership. They called Europeans \"Wogies\" also because of their light-skin. Some Chetco survivors viewed European genocide as retribution for their past sins of slavery. In another anti-slavery myth, a famous leader defeats an invading slaver group. Instead of enslaving them, the leaders sets his opponents and their slaves free. And he poignantly refuses to let the newly freed slaves carry his boat to the water.","title":"Americans of the Pacific Coast"},{"location":"pacific/#indigenous-americans-of-the-pacific-coast","text":"","title":"Indigenous Americans of the Pacific Coast"},{"location":"pacific/#yurok-karin-and-hupa-had-money-inheritance-and-a-work-ethic","text":"Peoples of Northern California, including the Yurok, Karin, and Hupa, had money in a sense that we would understand.

Their myths warned of the dangers of slave-ownership. In the Chetco's origin story, they canoed down from the north, wiped out the other warlike group, and enslaved the pacifist (and light-skinned) Wogies. They grew fat on the Wogies labor and skill. When the Wogies ran away, the \"lazy\" Chetco were unable to chase them. This was meant as a lesson on the physical and moral degradation that comes with slave-ownership. They called Europeans \"Wogies\" also because of their light-skin. Some Chetco survivors viewed European genocide as retribution for their past sins of slavery. In another anti-slavery myth, a famous leader defeats an invading slaver group. Instead of enslaving them, the leaders sets his opponents and their slaves free.

At some point(s) in human history, property rights had to be invented. Probably, property first emerged in rituals. Rituals are spaces for both rules and play Rituals are containers for accumulated social learning. And rituals create space for social experimentation. They are the laboratories and libraries of cultural knowledge. This dual role explains why rituals can be both formal and chaotic. Formality preserves old knowledge. Chaos promotes new ideas. For example, Yuletide is a chaotic ritual. The Lords of Misrule and Abbots of Unreason flipped the hierarchy of medieval Britain, and sometimes became the basis for popular revolts. In contrast, Catholic High Mass is a formal ritual that fixed a relatively singular understanding of God across hundreds of years. Totalitarianism is an attempt to make rituals last forever. Ancient Egypt's pyramids , like other cultures' massive monuments, were the Pharaohs' attempts to make their ritual power eternal. Private property began as sacred property Sacred rituals, led by holy men holding sacred objects and practices, may have been the origin of exclusive property rights. For many surviving Indigenous groups, including the Forest People of Central Africa, Aranda, and American Indians, sacred rights imply a duty to care for the land. (And it might not be entirely accidental that cultures that felt a duty to care for the land survived.) The Forest People of Central Africa's phallic and intellectual property Among the otherwise free Forest People of Central Africa certain phallic music instruments (flutes and trumpets, physical property) and ritual practices (intellectual property) are kept secret. These sacred instruments and practices are the only things which any individual or group can lay exclusive claim to. Women or children who use them can be raped or killed. (Ethnographer: James Woodburn) Aranda's violent initiation into manhood and property ownership For the Aranda, in the Australian Western Desert, adult men have the right to protect certain land. Their ownership is signified by churinga , smoothed and inscribed relics of wood or stone. The Aranda have carefree childhoods; they are spoiled and undisciplined. But the initiation from boyhood to manhood is oppressively violent. Boys may know of the churinga only after they undergo circumcision and sub-incision, and show complete, automatic obedience to elders. A duty to care for the land is conveyed through rituals of terror and torture. (Ethnographer: Emile Durkheim.) Indigenous American property established a duty to care Indigenous Americans (despite some of Kandiaronk's more hyperbolic claims) also had property rights. For example, among some Northwestern Americans ownership of a certain bowl implied the right to harvest berries from a particular patch. And for Totemic societies, including Plains Indians and Kwakiutl, membership in a clan (Bear clan, Raven clan, etc...) implied the exclusive rights to perform rituals meant to promote the abundance of those animals. At the same time, clan membership also meant you could never hunt that species. Abusus, the right to destroy For Europeans, property rights imply a right to destroy. This goes back to the Roman tradition. Roman property rights are actual a bundle of 3 core rights: Usus - the right to use; Fructus - the right to enjoy the products; and Abusus - the right to destroy. Usufruct, the right to use and enjoy, is incomplete. To have complete property rights you must have the right to destroy. John Locke relied on the Roman tradition when he provided the intellectual basis for dispossession of Americans. In the Second Treatise on Government (1690) Locke basically argued: \"They're not really working.\" Locke (wrongly) held that European-style agriculture and property was the only way to care for a landscape. Roman property rights were based on slavery. Roman legal theorists developed the concept of land ownership based on their experience as slave owners.

Care labor produces people Care labor produces people in both a physical and a social sense. Caregivers grow and cook the food that constitutes our physical bodies. And they raise us from children to adults. We gain our social identity through the care we give and receive. A parent is a parent because they care for a child. A subject requires a king. And slavery produces a luxury class, meaning that slaves allow their masters to become elites. Slavery is the theft of care labor Slavery steals care labor in two senses. First, the capturing society steals all the effort and love that the other society invested in that adult. Second, slaves typically perform care labor. They grow food. They cook. They wash and clothe and groom the masters. They raise the children. Capturing societies typically turn war prisoners into temporary slaves There are many examples of \"capturing societies\"... the Roman Empire; the Wendat; the Kwakiutl; Northwest Amazonian horticulturalists; Swabian (French) feudal barons and their German-speaking serfs; the Guaicur\u00fa, Nomadic hunter-gathers on the Paraguay River; and the Calusa, fisher-gathers in Florida. The diversity of these groups shows that slavery isn't a function of ecology or food production technology; it's a choice. Each group treated slaves differently, but shared two key commonalities... Slavery was social death. Slaves could become full members of society. Slaves can't make promises For the Romans, for example, all war prisoners were considered dead. Some lost their heads. Others lost kin and community. When a prisoner became a slave their social ties were severed. And they were prevented from making new social connections. Because they are dominated by the will of their master, slaves can't make promises. They cannot even make promises to themselves. Slaves are thus prevented from self-governance and making the sort of social commitments that establish community. Slaves can be freed Both the Wendat and Kwakiutl took great pride in their ability to integrate slaves into society. This was typical for many capturing societies. Slaves were adopted, like pets. They were fed and instructed in the proper ways of civilization. If they could successfully integrate into the new culture, the slave could become a full member of their adopted family. The Wendat and Kwakiutl differed, however, in that the Kwakiutl kept a large number of slaves in permanent limbo. The Wendat, in contrast, had no permanent slaves. After a trial period of domestication, Wendat prisoners either became full members of the family, or were tortured to death by the entire community. This torture is surprising because the Wendat even didn't spank their children. Yet even the children participated in this collective act of shocking violence. Graeber and Wengrow hypothesize that this moment of extreme, communal violence was meant to prevent individual acts of violence, and to keep the perpetual violence of slavery out of family life. Corv\u00e9e Distinction: corv\u00e9e is not necessarily slavery. For example, corv\u00e9e in Uruk was more like a festival of shared work on public projects, like temples and irrigation canals. This required work came with feasts and debt forgiveness--so, in contrast to slavery, it freed folks from bondage. Violence persists by confusing itself with care Most violence is fleeting: a moment of passion, a lone sociopath. Violence can last only when it is confused with care-taking. This isn't confusion in the sense of deception or false consciousness, but rather in the sense of getting tangled together. In Amazonia, for instance, property ownership is theorized based on an initial violent act (killing or capturing something from nature) followed by care (tending it). This is true of sovereignty as well. Tyrants always brag about how they care for the people, particularly widows. Royal courts are often made up of single women, orphans, disabled folks, and otherwise isolated individuals who need royal charity. These charity cases then become the servants and flunkeys who extend their leader's power. French Kings and Egyptian Pharaohs linked themselves to the people through a reciprocal chain of care. They \"cared for\" the people, and the people \"cared for\" them. The French people produced the luxury that defined the French court. The Egyptian people built the Pyramids to honor the dead Pharaoh. In return, French Kings and Egyptian Pharaohs acted as conduit to the spiritual realm on behalf of their people. Like the Wednat, the French also practiced public torture. For the French, however, the torture was construed as care. Public torture demonstrated and reaffirmed the proper relationship between King and subject. It was an act of tough love, a fatherly duty to correct the children. This public violence both justified, and was justified by, more intimate forms of violence, like violence between husband and wife, or parent and child. All of France's major institutions--religion (God's relation to man), government (king to subject), and family (husband to wife and parent to child)--each of these institutionalized violence by making domination the mode of care-taking.","title":"Slavery preserves violence by embedding it in social reproduction"},{"location":"slavery/#slavery-preserves-violence-by-embedding-it-in-social-reproduction","text":"All exploiters--bosses, landlords, kings, husbands, cannibals--consume the lives of the people they exploit.","title":"Slavery preserves violence by embedding it in social reproduction"},{"location":"slavery/#care-labor-produces-people","text":"Care labor produces people in both a physical and a social sense.

They raise the children.","title":"Slavery is the theft of care labor"},{"location":"slavery/#capturing-societies-typically-turn-war-prisoners-into-temporary-slaves","text":"There are many examples of \"capturing societies\"... the Roman Empire; the Wendat; the Kwakiutl; Northwest Amazonian horticulturalists; Swabian (French) feudal barons and their German-speaking serfs; the Guaicur\u00fa, Nomadic hunter-gathers on the Paraguay River; and the Calusa, fisher-gathers in Florida. The diversity of these groups shows that slavery isn't a function of ecology or food production technology; it's a choice. Each group treated slaves differently, but shared two key commonalities... Slavery was social death. Slaves could become full members of society.","title":"Capturing societies typically turn war prisoners into temporary slaves"},{"location":"slavery/#slaves-cant-make-promises","text":"For the Romans, for example, all war prisoners were considered dead. Some lost their heads. Others lost kin and community. When a prisoner became a slave their social ties were severed. And they were prevented from making new social connections. Because they are dominated by the will of their master, slaves can't make promises. They cannot even make promises to themselves. Slaves are thus prevented from self-governance and making the sort of social commitments that establish community.","title":"Slaves can't make promises"},{"location":"slavery/#slaves-can-be-freed","text":"Both the Wendat and Kwakiutl took great pride in their ability to integrate slaves into society. This was typical for many capturing societies. Slaves were adopted, like pets. They were fed and instructed in the proper ways of civilization. If they could successfully integrate into the new culture, the slave could become a full member of their adopted family. The Wendat and Kwakiutl differed, however, in that the Kwakiutl kept a large number of slaves in permanent limbo. The Wendat, in contrast, had no permanent slaves. After a trial period of domestication, Wendat prisoners either became full members of the family, or were tortured to death by the entire community. This torture is surprising because the Wendat even didn't spank their children. Yet even the children participated in this collective act of shocking violence. Graeber and Wengrow hypothesize that this moment of extreme, communal violence was meant to prevent individual acts of violence, and to keep the perpetual violence of slavery out of family life.","title":"Slaves can be freed"},{"location":"slavery/#corvee","text":"Distinction: corv\u00e9e is not necessarily slavery. For example, corv\u00e9e in Uruk was more like a festival of shared work on public projects, like temples and irrigation canals. This required work came with feasts and debt forgiveness--so, in contrast to slavery, it freed folks from bondage.","title":"Corv\u00e9e"},{"location":"slavery/#persists","text":"Most violence is fleeting: a moment of passion, a lone sociopath. Violence can last only when it is confused with care-taking. This isn't confusion in the sense of deception or false consciousness, but rather in the sense of getting tangled together. In Amazonia, for instance, property ownership is theorized based on an initial violent act (killing or capturing something from nature) followed by care (tending it). This is true of sovereignty as well. Tyrants always brag about how they care for the people, particularly widows. Royal courts are often made up of single women, orphans, disabled folks, and otherwise isolated individuals who need royal charity. These charity cases then become the servants and flunkeys who extend their leader's power. French Kings and Egyptian Pharaohs linked themselves to the people through a reciprocal chain of care. They \"cared for\" the people, and the people \"cared for\" them. The French people produced the luxury that defined the French court. The Egyptian people built the Pyramids to honor the dead Pharaoh. In return, French Kings and Egyptian Pharaohs acted as conduit to the spiritual realm on behalf of their people. Like the Wednat, the French also practiced public torture. For the French, however, the torture was construed as care. Public torture demonstrated and reaffirmed the proper relationship between King and subject. It was an act of tough love, a fatherly duty to correct the children. This public violence both justified, and was justified by, more intimate forms of violence, like violence between husband and wife, or parent and child. All of France's major institutions--religion (God's relation to man), government (king to subject), and family (husband to wife and parent to child)--each of these institutionalized violence by making domination the mode of care-taking.","title":"Violence persists by confusing itself with care"},{"location":"sovereignty/","text":"Sovereignty is the control of violence Sovereigns prove they make the law by breaking the law Kings often establish themselves through extraordinary violence or by otherwise violating important norms (incest, etc...) This break establishes the King as above common law, and thus capable of making law himself. It's no coincidence that, Zeus, the maker of divine law and judge of mortal men, also randomly throws lightning. Aside on capitalism as another violent break from tradition... Capitalism required founders willing to break with social norms of redistribution. As Max Weber noted, the Calvinists who invented capitalism lacked moral ways to spend their money, and they thought their neighbors were damned. This faith gave them the willingness to resist the cultural expectation of sharing wealth. Contrast the Calvinists with the more typical Nambikwara of the Amazon, and Northwest American tradition of Potlatch . For most cultures, wealth is proved through redistribution. Stranger Kings Dynasties are often started by outsiders. These stranger kings may be more willing to engage in the violence required to establish domination. For example, some Classical Mayan art, like at Tikal, features kings in Teotihuacan clothing. This is odd because the Teotihuacans didn't have kings themselves. Perhaps these merchant-warriors, 600+ miles from home, seized an opportunity. Hernan Cort\u00e9s certainly tried to do the same thing to the Aztec .

Sovereignty is self-limiting An absolute sovereign, like the Sun-God-Kings of the French or Th\u00e9olo\u00ebl or Inca , has the theoretical right to do unlimited violence. But, absent bureaucracy or charisma, sovereignty tends to limits itself. At the extreme, a sovereign asserts absolute, arbitrary control over every subject's possessions, actions, life, and even afterlife. These divine kings are limited in 2 ways. The king's authority is so personal, they can't delegate it. Rituals that affirm the king's divine status limit their freedom of action. For example, the Shilluk and Th\u00e9olo\u00ebl mostly avoided their Sun-God-King. The Sapa Inca had to build a massive road system to personally collect taxes. Divine Kings tend to demand respect commensurate with their status. Their feet cannot touch the ground; or the sun may never shine on them; etc...
