# the Upper Paleolithic Revolution and Sapient Paradox aren't real

The "Upper Paleolithic Revolution" happened around 45,000 BCE in N. Europe.
For some time, this was the oldest evidence of human culture.

The gap in time between our capacity to make culture and the first evidence of it, puzzled archeologists.
They called this the "Sapient Paradox."
Answers tended to credit something special about northern European peoples.
Europeans have used this to claim that they are the protectors of human culture and civilization.

The climate may have been a factor.
There was a little Ice Age in Europe 45,000 BCE years ago.
People probably spent a lot of time inside.

But this isn't actually the first evidence of culture.
In Africa, we've recently found symbolic representation going back to at least 100,000 BCE.
And there's good reason to think we'll find older evidence, as archeologists haven't spent much time in much of Africa.

The real explanation for the Sapient Paradox is that European governments are rich.
Europeans can afford to do archeology.
45,000 BCE is just when humans got to Europe.
