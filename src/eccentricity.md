# Eccentricity is socially useful

Slightly odd people make good leaders.
Spiritual visionaries and prophets tend to be divergent.

Weirdness is a useful social resource during emergencies and periods of rapid change.

Indigenous Americans, like the Winnebago, valued eccentricity.
They might worry that the gods would punish someone who had invented an entirely new cosmology.
But they wouldn't punish them, themselves.

Ethnographer on the Winnebago: Paul Radin, Primitive Man as Philosopher (1927)
