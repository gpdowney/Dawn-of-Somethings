# Bureaucracy is the control of information

Bureaucracies exert power through exclusive access to knowledge.
This might take the form of special access to divine knowledge or spiritual rituals.

The first examples of ledgers, files, audits, and overseers include:

- [Pharaonic Egyptian](/egypt) ancestor cults
- Chinese oracle readings
- [Chavín de Huántar's](/chavin) shamanic art

Bureaucracy today more typically takes the form of secular expertise, particularly economics.
This is not accidental.

Money and administration consistently emerge together.
They are both sources of [impersonal equivalence](/equality).

## Mesopotamian temple workshops invent money to prevent inequality

The earliest examples of administrative counting and record-keeping emerged in Mesopotamian temples.

The very first ledgers come from Tell Sabi Abyad, in Mesopotamia (present day Syria) from circa 6200 BCE.
It wasn't writing.
It was marked clay tokens that symbolized access to resources (like food).

In Kurdistan, circa 4500 BCE, quantification was part of a project to deliberately erase differences between people.
At the same time as ledgers come into use, houses are increasingly built on a standard plan, and pottery becomes more dull.
Innovations in metal-working, textiles, horticulture, and trade seem to have been counter-balanced by deliberate efforts to prevent those technologies from becoming sources of rank or hierarchy.

Administrative equivalence-making was one tool meant to ensure that everyone was equal.
The quantification of debts and labor were initially designed to *prevent* wealth accumulation.

## Inca Ayllus formalized equality into oppression

Similarly, Ayllu, [Inca](/inca) Village Associations, deeply valued equality.
Members wore uniforms.
They redistributed agricultural land.
They took care of the aged, infirm, widows, orphans, and disabled.

As the Incan state grew in power, the Ayllu turned community leaders into state agents.
These agents enriched themselves and their friends.
While others, who were unable to meet the higher demands of the central state, fell into debt and became servants to the Inca court.
By the time of Spanish conquest, there was a rapidly growing population of hereditary debt peons.

Bureaucracies are dangerous because they are impersonal.
Reducing everything to numbers provides a language of equity.
But it also ignores the uniqueness of each individual situation.

Giving everyone the same quota ensures that some people will be unable to meet it.
Without clear systems of accounting, things can be adjusted, a solution can be found.
When control is rationalized, people who fall behind become peons or slaves.
The oppressors can say: "the rules are the rules."

## Sumerian temple-workshops invent wage slavery by doing charity

Sumerian temples took in needy folks, like refugees, criminals, disabled folks, unmarried women, etc...
These temples were also centers of economic activity.
They were more like factories.
And they put the objects of their charity to work.
And then tracked that work with their new systems of accounting (see above).

This is the first example of wage slavery.
Perhaps this teaches us something about charity, in general.
