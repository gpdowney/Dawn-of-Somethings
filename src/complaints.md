# Complaints about *the Dawn of Everything*

As you can hopefully tell from these notes, I was deeply inspired by *the Dawn of Everything*.
But I was also deeply frustrated by it.

*The Dawn of Everything* is unkind to readers.

It is poorly written, disorganized, and whiney.

## Poorly written

Like many academic authors, the Davids seem afraid of periods.

They cram too many ideas into long sentences, break those ideas up with distracting parentheticals, and confound the reader with unnecessarily fancy language.

## Disorganized

The book is full of digressions.

The Davids do apologize for the constant interruptions.
But if they knew to apologize, that means they knew they were making things hard on the reader.
Instead of apologizing, they should have put in the work to organize their own thinking.

As a substitute for organization, the Davids provide frequent and tedious roadmap paragraphs.
Unfortunately, these roadmaps are ineffectively broad.
Rather than connecting the details or guiding the way forward, they tend to repeat the same big picture conclusions.

## Whiney

One of those frequently repeated points is some version of: "mainstream academics are stupid or lazy."

This academic bickering is boring and confusing.
Reading the book often reminded me of one of my least favorite types of conversation: when a friend complains about people I don't know.

And the arrogance of this whining doesn't inspire confidence.
My general heuristic is: if I think everyone else is being an idiot, there's a good chance I'm the idiot.

And this bickering clashed with another of the Davids' frequently repeated points: that they are merely summarizing recent academic research.
