# Uruk

Sumerian city, circa 3500 BCE, population 20,000-50,000.

Uruk is the first known site of writing, a cuneiform script.
And the first epic: Gilgamesh.

## Uruk was democratically run until 3000 BCE

Uruk's Houses of the Gods were large public buildings modeled on homes.
And the Great Court featured rows of benches and shade trees, like the Agora and Pnyx of Classical Athens, suggesting broad public political participation.

From 5000-3000 BCE, none of the Sumerian cities show evidence of royalty.
This lack of evidence is in contrast to the neighboring Semitic ruins.
And the lack of evidence is persuasive evidence because Mesopotamia has been deeply studied,
and particularly studied by European archeologists who were looking for the kings and empires mentioned in the Bible.

## Temple Workshops and Community Councils

Uruk's Temples were the centers of economic life.
Temple bureaucrats invented commodity production.
Temples produced standardized and purified commodities, including wool, beer, wine, bread, and preserved fish.

The temple bureaucrats were meticulous writers.
Their records are the first evidence of quantifying labor.
And the source of our base-60 time-keeping system.

In contrast to the top-down economics, Uruk's politics were governed by autonomous neighborhood councils and city-wide assemblies.
Unlike the temples economic records, political decisions were mostly unwritten.

## Heroic Revolution by former colonies {#heroic-revolt}

Around 3000 BCE, open spaces were destroyed.
They were replaced by gated courts and ziggurats, suggesting a new hierarchy.
Plus a fortification wall, and signs of rival warlords like aristocratic burials.

At this time, Uruk was captured by its former colonies, which had become warlike heroic societies.

Uruk had established many colonies along trade routes.
These colonies began with a temple like Uruk's, with no fortifications or weapons.
For example, Arslantepe, in eastern Turkey, was established around 3300 BCE.
Within a few generations, the temple was destroyed and replaced with the earliest known palace.
The palace was filled with copper weapons and featured elaborate tombs.
A warrior aristocracy had emerged at Arslantepe, in opposition to the peaceful egalitarianism of Uruk.

This is another example of [cultures defining themselves in opposition](/schismogensis) to each other.

Note: the Code of Hammurabi dates from after this heroic revolution, and comes from Susa.
