# Sovereignty is the control of violence

## Sovereigns prove they make the law by breaking the law

Kings often establish themselves through extraordinary violence and/or by violating important norms (incest, etc...)
This break establishes the King as above common law, and thus capable of making law himself.

For example, Zeus, the maker of divine law and judge of mortal men, also randomly throws lightning.

Similarly, capitalism required founders willing to break with social norms of redistribution.
The calvinists who invented modern capitalism lacked moral ways to spend their money, and they thought their neighbors were damned.

## Stranger Kings

Similarly, many dynasties are started by outsiders, stranger kings.
Outsiders may be more willing to engage in the violence required to establish a monarchy.

Some Mayan art, like at Tikal, features kings in [Teotihuacan](/teotihuacan) clothing.
This is odd because the Teotihuacans didn't have kings themselves.
Perhaps these merchant-warriors, 600+ miles from home, seized an opportunity.
Hernan Cortés certainly tried to do the same thing to the [Aztec](/aztec).

In Hawaii, Captain James Cook was treated like "Lono," an ancient Polynesian fertility god.

## Sovereignty is self-limiting

An absolute sovereign, like the Sun God-Kings of the French or [Théoloël](/theoloel) or [Inca](/inca), has the theoretical right to do unlimited violence
But, absent other systems of control, sovereignty limits itself.

At the extreme, a sovereign asserts absolute, arbitrary control over every subject's possessions and life.

These Divine Kings are limited in 2 ways.

1. The King's authority is so personal, they can't delegate it.
2. Rituals that affirm status limit the king's freedom of action.

For example, the Shilluk and [Théoloël](/theoloel) simply avoided their Sun-God-King.

The [Sapa Inca](/inca) couldn't delegate his authority.
He had to build a massive road system to personally collect taxes.

Divine Kings tend to demand respect commensurate with their status.
Their feet cannot touch the ground; or
the sun may never shine on them; etc...
Thus a maze of ritual contains the absolute sovereign's capacity for unlimited violence.
