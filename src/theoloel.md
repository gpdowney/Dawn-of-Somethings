# Théoloël (aka Natchez)

The Théoloël were a 1st-order empire: absolute sovereignty, without charisma (they didn't like the leader) or bureaucracy (his control was only local).

They were one of the last of the Mississippian cultures.

These "people of the sun" were subjects of an absolutely powerful Sun God.
But they tended, the Jesuits noticed, to live far away from that Sun God.
