# Scale doesn't determine social organization

Big societies can be simple and egalitarian.
Small societies can be complex and hierarchical.

Dense and successful civilizations need to be violent or hierarchical:

- [Uruk](/uruk) in Mesopotamia lacked walls and signs of hierarchy (until it was taken over by their former colonies).
- Mohenjo-daro of the [Indus Valley Civilization](/indus-valley) was hierarchical but peaceful; there are no signs of a warrior class until 1000 years later.
- In the Buddha's time (564 BCE), many South Asian cities were led by democratic councils called sangas that operated by consensus.
- Taosi in the Jinnan Basin of China had the first known revolution (2000 BCE). They trashed the palace and lived in relative prosperity for the next 200 years.
- Around 300 CE, [Teotihuacans](/teotihuacan) revolted. They stopped building pyramids and started building public housing instead.
- [Bali's](/bali) seemingly rigid caste system mixes formal hierarchy with informal equality.

## Cities weren't a shock

Non-urban people were part of large networks of humans.
These groups may have been more geographically spread out, but there's nothing innately human about small groups.

For example, a member of a totemic society in the pre-Colombian Americas would have had strong social ties from Arizona to Ontario.

## Families aren't fundamental

Social bonds across broad distances allowed folks to leave their biological family and become part of a different, chosen family.

Indigenous peoples are often found in "families" that have few genetic relationships.
