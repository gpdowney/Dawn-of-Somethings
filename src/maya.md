# Classical Maya

The Classical Maya were a centralized empire.

Around 800 CE a popular revolt led to decentralization.
Monarchs were reduced to ceremonial powers.
Monuments like Chichen Itza became assembly halls, or were abandoned.
They stopped playing ball games.

The revolt may have been led by women.
Art after 800 CE shows a rise in the prominence of women.

When the Classical Maya civilization "collapsed," millions of people disappeared.
Unlike earlier [Olmec](/olmec) "collapses" this one did effect folks in the countryside.
This "collapse" was not just a disaster, but also a choice.

By the time of Spanish conquest, Maya culture was completely decentralized.
And the culture featured many stories that described the disasters that had and would befall would-be-kings.

The decentralized Maya, in contrast to the empires of the [Aztec](/aztec) and [Inca](/inca), were difficult to conquer.
Revolts began as soon as conquest finished, and continued through the 1800s and 1900s.
Arguably, with the Zapatistas, they still haven't been conquered.
