# About the Site

This site is an abridged outline of *the Dawn of Everything* by David Graeber and David Wengrow.

I'm Graham.
Like most readers of the *Dawn of Everything*, I'm not an expert on anthropology or archeology.

In 2021, I excitedly bought *the Dawn of Everything*.
Then, for 18 months, I failed to read it.
These notes helped me, finally, get through it.

I'm sharing these notes with you in the hopes of making the fresh and challenging ideas of *the Dawn of Everything* more accessible.

- For **dedicated** readers, I hope these notes provide some structure that helps you navigate and appreciate the book.
- For **critical** readers, these notes may help you identify the book's core claims so that they can be more clearly evaluated as true or false.
- For **busy** readers, perhaps these notes are all you need, and you can skip the book.

If you'd like to also enjoy the benefits of making some notes,
or if you think anything here is wrong (whether the mistake is mine or the Davids'),
I'd love to add your thoughts to this website.

- There's a link at the bottom of each page that will take you to [GitHub](https://github.com/gpdowney/Dawn-of-Somethings), where you can suggest edits.
- Or you can email <dawn@gpdetc.org> with any feedback, including additions, corrections, compliments, or criticisms.

Incidentally, if you are David Wengrow...

1. Thank you for writing this amazing book.
1. I would be thrilled to collaborate on an official abridged edition.
