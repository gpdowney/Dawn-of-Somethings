# About the Site

Hi y'all, I'm [Graham](https://gpdetc.org/about.html)!

This site is my personal attempt at an abridged outline of *the Dawn of Everything* by David Graeber and David Wengrow.
It has not been reviewed or endorsed by the authors or publishers.

- For **dedicated** readers, I hope these notes provide some structure that helps you navigate and appreciate the book.
- For **critical** readers, these notes may help you identify the book's core claims so that they can be more clearly evaluated as true or false.
- For **busy** readers, perhaps these notes are all you need, and you can skip the book.

## How to get around the site

The home page, which you can access from the top of each page, has a 2-part table of contents that links to every note.

The first part lists the ideas I found most interesting.
The second part lists human cultures that I took more than a few lines of notes on.

Also at the top of each page, you'll see a left facing and right facing angles.
These are links that will take you backward or forward through the table of contents.
There's also a more descriptive link to the next page at the bottom of each page.

There may be internal links on each page, within the paragraphs.
These links mostly take you to other pages on that topic.
If you click one of these links, you'll need to use your browser's back button to return.

## Why'd I publish these notes?

Sometime in 2021, I excitedly bought *the Dawn of Everything*.
Then, for nearly 2 years, I failed to read it.
As interesting as the ideas and stories seemed, I struggled to get through the book's poor organization.

These notes are what finally got me to the end.

I'm sharing them with you in the hopes of making the fresh and challenging ideas of *the Dawn of Everything* more accessible.

Like most readers of the *Dawn of Everything*, I'm not an expert on anthropology or archeology.
If you think anything here is incorrect, whether you think I've misunderstood Graeber and Wengrow, or whether you think Davids are wrong, please let me know.

- There's a link at the bottom of each page that will take you to the markdown file associated with that page, where you can suggest edits.
- Or you can email <dawn@gpdetc.org> with any feedback, including additions, corrections, compliments, or criticisms.

If you'd like to also enjoy the benefits of making some notes,
I'd love to add your thoughts to this site.

Incidentally, if you are David Wengrow...

1. Thank you for writing this amazing book.
1. I would be thrilled to collaborate on an official abridged edition.
